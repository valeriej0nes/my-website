                <p class="archivo-regular">
                    I’m Valerie, a final-year Mathematics student at the University of Bath with a lifelong love for numbers
                    and problem-solving. Maths has always been my way of understanding the world - it’s the language that explains
                    patterns, uncovers hidden connections, and turns complexity into clarity. Along the way, I discovered data science,
                    and it felt like the perfect bridge between theory and impact. Suddenly, the abstract beauty of maths could be
                    applied to real-world challenges - from predicting engineering parameters to optimising workflows - across
                    industries I’d never imagined working in. What excites me most is the mix of creativity and logic: asking
                    the right questions, shaping messy datasets into meaningful insights, and building models that can genuinely
                    make a difference.
                </p>

                <p class="archivo-regular">
                    Beyond academics, I’m an active member of the University’s rowing team, where I combine my love of sport with my
                    passion for data. I enjoy applying performance analytics to training - tracking metrics, visualising trends, and
                    using statistical insights to refine technique and strategy. Whether on the water or at my desk, I’m motivated by
                    curiosity, adaptability, and the belief that data, when interpreted well, can inspire improvement and deliver
                    meaningful results.

                <p class="archivo-regular">
                    In 2024-2025 I went on a placement year at GE Aerospace, I immersed myself in the challenge of applying
                    machine learning to high-dimensional time series and sensor data from aircraft engines. I built and evaluated
                    supervised learning models - including Random Forest, MLP, and KNN - optimising performance through hyperparameter
                    tuning and feature importance analysis. I also explored Bayesian networks for anomaly detection, integrated SQL
                    queries into large-scale cloud-based pipelines, and used PySpark to streamline model development. Beyond the technical
                    skills, I learned how to work within a rigorous engineering environment - collaborating across teams, maintaining high
                    coding standards, and automating workflows to save significant time for downstream analysts.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the summer before that, I joined Edwards Vacuum as a Data Analyst Intern in their Business & Logistics department,
                    where I developed algorithms to flag inefficiencies in product transport, leading to tangible cost-saving actions across
                    global operations. I also introduced machine learning to predict customer behaviour, sparking internal discussions about
                    integrating advanced analytics into forecasting practices. This role sharpened my ability to translate technical results
                    into clear, business-oriented recommendations for executives.<br>
                    <br>
                    Alongside industry experience, my Mathematics degree at the University of Bath has given me a solid foundation of many
                    subjects such as linear algebra, statistics, numerical analysis, and machine learning. I’ve learned to approach problems
                    methodically, balance precision with efficiency, and adapt theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. The combination of
                    mathematical rigour and hands-on programming has prepared me to tackle complex analytical challenges with both technical depth
                    and creative problem-solving.

                    I am most comfortable with Python, SQL, and Spark for data manipulation and analysis. These are the languages I spent most
                    of my placement working with. I also have used R in my summer internship as well as in my university studies. I have some experience
                    with HTML, and CSS, which I used to build this website, and have a basic understanding of web development.
